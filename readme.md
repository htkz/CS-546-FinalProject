The idea of the application is to allow users to book tickets for tourism. The value of the application is apparent, many organizations like museum will need their own websites to sell tickets.

Core features:
1. Main page
The main page after login will show the tickets that users can book. The user can change the sorting of tickets either by the “latest” ticket or the “hottest” ticket which sells most.
2. Detail page
This page will show the detail of the ticket, which would include some pictures and text. Also, it will have a book button for users to book this ticket.
3. User center page
This page is for users to have a look at his/her information and his tickets. On this page, there will be two toggles on the left. 
3.1. The first part is user information. In this part, users can view and change their personal information, like name, phone number, email. 
3.2. The second part is the ticket information. In this part, users can view their booked tickets. They can also reschedule their ticket time or cancel their ticket.

Extra features:
1. Comment
Users can post comments for the tickets which will be displayed on the detail page in the order of posted time.
2. Payment information
People can add payment information in the user center page. We do not check whether the payment information is real in the world, but we will check the format of the information. For instance, we will check whether the card number is all digits and its length.
3. Other people’s information
Users can add other people’s information so that they can buy tickets for other people.
